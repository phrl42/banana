# banana
a work in progress game engine made in c for fun

# Usage
<p>Required libraries: SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf</p>

<p>put your files in src</p>
<p>It should be self-explanatory till now, as it is simple.</p>
<p>The Documentation will be coming soon.</p>
<p>As of now this Engine supports simple things such as:</p>

- [x] initializations and co
- [x] implement sdl_image
- [x] implement sdl_mixer
- [x] implement sdl_ttf
- [x] implement input
- [ ] fix input function
- [ ] physics
- [ ] documentation
- [ ] make the code more beautiful

For now it is advised to not use the built-in input functions, as they do not work, and yet I don't have a clue why. You should use the normal sdl2 functions. See src/main.c for an example
