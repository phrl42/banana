a work in progress OpenGL SDL2 engine made in c for fun

# Usage
<p>Required libraries: SDL2, SDL2_mixer and you should have opengl installed (if not already...)</p>

<p>View the source code for a half broken documentation</p>
<p>Edit src/game.c and include/game.h as you wish..</p>

# Todo:
- [ ] fix fps counter
- [ ] implement input
- [x] documentation
- [ ] clean code
