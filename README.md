# Banana Game Engine

This is an experimental game engine which I personally use to learn about graphics and game development

I have been inspired by <a href="https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel">Cherno</a> in terms of abstraction.

# Instructions

In order to generate makefiles, run:

```premake5 gmake2```

Compile as follows:

```make```

Run game binary:

```bin/target/Debug/Sandbox/Sandbox```
